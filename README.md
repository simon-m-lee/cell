A reactive programming framework centered around the [Cell] class and its extensions,
particularly the [Collective] family of classes that implement reactive collections
[CollectiveSet], [CollectiveList], [CollectiveQueue] and [CollectionValue].
This framework provides a comprehensive reactive programming solution for Dart, with
particular strength in managing complex state and data flow in applications.

## Features

1. Reactive Programming Model: Automatic propagation of changes through a network of cells

2. Validation System: Configurable rules for what operations are allowed

3. Flexible Signal Processing: Customizable signal transformation and propagation

4. Collection Support: Reactive versions of common collection types (Set, List, Queue, Value)

5. Modifiable/Unmodifiable Views: Both mutable and immutable variants of all containers

6. Asynchronous Support: Async interfaces for all modifiable operations

## Core Components and Their Relationships

1. [Cell] - The Fundamental Reactive Unit

   Purpose: Acts as the basic building block of reactivity

2. [Receptor] - Signal Processing

   Purpose: Handles signal transformation and propagation

3. [Synapses] - Inter-Cell Communication

   Purpose: Manages connections between cells

4. [Properties] - Cell Configuration

   Purpose: Contains all configurable aspects of a cell

5. [TestRule]/[TestObject] - Validation System

   Purpose: Provides validation rules for cell operations

6. [Signal] - Data Carrier

   Purpose: Carries data between cells

7. [Deputy] - Delegation Pattern

   Purpose: Delegates to original [Cell] with reduced permissions or accesses

## Key Architectural Patterns

1. Reactive Flow:

   - [Signal]s enter through [Receptor]

   - [TestObject] validates the [Signal]

   - If valid, processed by `Receptor.transform`

   - Output signal propagated via [Synapses]

2. Decorator Pattern:

   - [Deputy] wraps cells to modify behavior

   - [CellAsync] adds asynchronous capabilities

3. Composite Pattern:

   - [TestObject] can contain multiple [TestRule] instances

   - [Collective] types manage collections of cells using
     [CollectiveSet], [CollectiveList], [CollectiveQueue] and [CollectiveQueue].

4. Strategy Pattern:

   - Different [Receptor] implementations handle signal processing

   - [Synapses] implementations vary propagation behavior


## Getting started

To use this package, add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cell: ^<latest_version>

```

Then, run `dart pub get` to install the package.

```dart
import 'package:cell/cell.dart';
import 'package:cell/collective.dart';

```

## Usage

```dart

// Create a basic cell
final cell = Cell();
final boundCell = Cell(bind: cell);

// Create a listening cell
final listener = Cell.listen<String>(
  bind: baseCell,
  listen: (signal, _) => print('Received: ${signal.body}'),
);

// Create a transforming cell
final transformer = Cell.signaling<Signal<String>, Signal<int>(
  bind: baseCell,
  map: (signal, _) => Signal<int>(signal.body?.length),
);

```

Example: with [Collective] bounded

```dart
// Create source cell
final source = CollectiveValue<int>(5);

// Create transformed cell
final squared = Cell.signaling<int,int>(
 bind: source,
  transform: (signal, _) => Signal(signal.body * signal.body)
);

// Create logger
final logger = Cell.listen<int>(
  bind: squared,
  listen: (signal, _) => print('Value squared: ${signal.body}')
);

// Update source - automatically propagates
source.value = 10; // Logs "Value squared: 100"
```
